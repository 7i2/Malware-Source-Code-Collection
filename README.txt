Setting bot
Step by step installation:
1) From your existing build the package, run the file 'local \ cp.exe', is a builder and konifguratsii bot file
2) Open the 'Builder' section. Click 'Browse' and specify where the configuration file, the name of the MDM 'local \ config.txt'.
3) Click 'Edit config', the result should start a text editor. Reconfigure file like this:

first:
The source configuration file is a text file in Windows coding, and need only to create the final configuration file (which is a binary file to download bot) and the bot. In your package assembly example of the configuration file must be located in the folder 'local' and be named config.txt. Open the file can be in any text editor, for example 'Notepad' (Notepad).

The file consists of records, one record per line. Recording same consists of parameters, the first parameter typically determines the account name (but this is not always the case, for example, in cases when there is any transfer of data, no name). The parameters are separated by spaces, but if in the parameter meets a space or tab character, this option must be enclosed in double quotes ( "), the same rule applies to the name. The number of parameters is not limited, and if the recording has a name, it read insensitive
examples:
username Kot Matroskin
write the name - username, option 1 - Kot, option 2 - Matroskin.

username "James" Bond "
write the name - username, option 1 - James, option 2 - Bond.

username "Volodia Putin"
write the name - username, option 1 - Volodia Putin.

"Url" "http://sex.com/" index.php
write the name - url, option 1 - http://sex.com/, option 2 - index.php

Also, there are special record names that allows to divide the configuration file as you want subsections, which may contain within itself any number of subsections and records. They are called sections and consist of a name and parameter entry determines the name of the section (Register also not taken into account in this parameter), the end of the section designated end recording. Further documentation, nested records regarding subsections, will be designated by ->. Those. Entries with the name username belonging userdata list will be marked as userdata-> username, etc.

examples:
entry "userdata"
fname "petia"
lname "lolkin"
end

entry compdata
name "pcvasya"
entry devices - section contents example, when the recording has no name, it is simply talking device enumeration.
cdrom
"Hdd"
fdd
end
end

There is also the possibility to insert comments, comments must be in a separate line and begin with the character ';'. If it turns out that the first parameter in the recording also starts with ';', this parameter should be enclosed in quotes.

examples:
; Hello.I think that I'm hero!
; How are you / is a no entry
"; I love you" - but this is a record.

second
Configuration File Entries
The file consists of two sections and StaticConfig DynamicConfig.

StaticConfig, the values ​​in this section are written directly into the bot's file, ie in the exe, and define the basic behavior of the bot on the victim's computer.
Depending on your build, some details may not be for you the values ​​of all relevant parameters prescribed in the example attached to the package assembly.
botnet [string] - specifies the name of a botnet, which owns the boat.
string - the name of a botnet, up to 4 characters, or 0 - for the default values.

Recommended value: botnet 0

timer_config [number1] [number2] - specifies the time interval over which should receive updatings configuration file.
number1 - determines the time in minutes after which you must update the configuration file, in case of a successful download previous time.
number2 - determines the time in minutes after which you must update the configuration file, in case of an error during previous boot time.

Recommended value: timer_config 60 5

timer_logs [number1] [number1] - specifies the time interval over which to send the collected logs to the server.
number1 - determines the time in minutes after which the logs should be sent, in case of successful sending of the previous time.
number2 - determines the time in minutes after which the logs should be sent, in the event of an error when sending the previous time.

Recommended value: timer_logs February 2

TIMER_STATS [number1] [number2] - specifies the time interval over which statistics should be sent to the server. (Includes inastally finding in the online, open ports, services a socks, screenshots, etc.)
number1 - determines the time in minutes after which statistics should be sent in cases of successful sending of the previous time.
number2 - determines the time in minutes after which statistics should be sent, in the event of an error when sending previous file again.

Recommended value: timer_logs October 20

url_config [url] - URL that is located on the main configuration file, parametor this is the most important, if the infection kompyuetra victim as directed by the URL will not be available this configuration, the infection does not make sense.

url_compip [url] [number] - specifies the site where you can check your IP, it is used to determine the NAT.
url - specifies the URL of the web
number - defines kolichetsvo bytes, which is enough to download from the site to see the downloaded to your IP.

blacklist_languages ​​[number1] [number2] ... [chisloX] - specifies a list of Windows language code, for which the bot will always spyashem in Safe Mode, ie it will not send logs and stats, but will refer to the configuration file.
chisloX - language code, such as RU - 1049, to EN - 1033.

DynamicConfig, the values ​​in this section are written into the final configuration file.
Depending on your build, some details may not be for you the values ​​of all relevant parameters prescribed in the example attached to the package assembly.
url_loader [url] - specifies the URL, where you can download the update bot. This parameter is relevant only if you have started a new bot on the botnet version and configuration prescribed by it for the same the URL, and that the old configuration, in which case the old version of the robot will be updated by downloading the file specified in this record.

url_server [url] - specifies the URL, which will be sent on the statistics, files, logs, etc. to victim computers.

file_webinjects - specifies a local file, which is a list of web izhektov. Description of the format of this file can be found here

Subsection AdvancedConfigs - enumerates the list of the URL, which you can download a backup configuration file, in case of non availability of the main file. It is recommended to fill in this subsection 1-3 URL, which will save the botnet from destruction in case of unavailability of the main configuration file, and the result is easy to translate it to another server. Mandatory presence of files on this URL is not required, then the main thing to be able to put the files on this URL. Files should be mixed there only after the discovery of the inaccessibility of the main configuration file, if you always want to have files by this URL, you should update them all simultaneously with the main configuration file. Backup files are not be distinguished from the core, and are the same.

Example:
entry "AdvancedConfigs"
"Http: //url1/cdffd.ccc"
"Http: //url2/cdf34.dc"
end

Note: for the URL listed in this section ignore the value of the parameter StaticConfig.ignore_http

Example:
entry "WebFilters"
; In the log will be written by all of the URL matches with the mask.
"Http://www.google.com/*"
; In the log will not be written all the URL matches with the mask.
